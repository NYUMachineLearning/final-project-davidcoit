This repository contains David Coit's submission for Machine Learning final project Fall 2019. The code contained herein represetns my exploration of the "Connectomics" Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectomics

This repository contains:

- A jupyter notebook "preprocessing and partial correlation," which contains the code used to perform network-weighted spike detection and both continuous and discrete partial correlation.

- Two example python scripts, "granger_06." and "mic_06", which were run on NYU's Big Purple HPC cluster to calculate inter-time series statistics. 6 iterations of each script were run on respective fluorescence data.

- A jupyter notebook "AssembleDF" which was used to create the pandas dataframe on which analysis was performed.

- A jupyter notebook "AnalyzeDF," which contains the substantive analysis of the processed data, including results from random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor supervised learning as well as PCA and correlation plots from the generated statistics.

- A pdf "David Coit machine learning project, final presentation" which contains the slides I discussed in class. Note: model performance has improved since the presentation, as evidenced by figures in the AnalyzeDF jupyter notebook.
